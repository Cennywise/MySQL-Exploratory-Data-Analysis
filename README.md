# World Layoffs Exploratory Data Analysis

This SQL analysis explores layoff data across the world from March of 2020 to March of 2023. The dataset comes from another of my project repositories where I cleaned the original, raw dataset. Below are the findings of my exploration.

The single largest layoff was January 20, 2023 when Google laid off 12,000 employees. In total, Amazon had the most layoffs at 18,150, which makes sense because Amazon also employs more than any other company. For example, on January 4, 2023, it laid off 8000 employees, and that was only 2% of its company.

The highest percent of itself that any company laid off was 100%. This is obvious when you realize that any company going out of business lays off 100% of its employees. The wealthiest company to lay off all its employees was Britishvolt, which had raised $2.4 billion before going under.

While small companies are more likely to go out of business, it is big companies that are responsible for the most layoffs since they have more employees to potentially be laid off. Companies in the Post-IPO stage were responsible for 204,132 layoffs, which was more than the combined layoffs of the companies in every other stage. Those 204,132 layoffs are 53% of the total layoffs in this dataset. The grand total of all layoffs is 383,159.

Finally, I isolated the top 5 companies with the most layoffs for each year from 2020 to 2023, and the resultant table is shown below.

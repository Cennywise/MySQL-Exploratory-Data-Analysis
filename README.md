# World Layoffs Exploratory Data Analysis

This SQL analysis explores layoff data across the world from the years 2020 to 2023. These were the findings.

The single largest layoff was January 20, 2023 when Google laid off 12,000 employees. Amazon had the most layoffs in total with 18,150. This makes sense because Amazon also employs more than any other company. On January 4, 2023, it laid off 8000 employees, but that was only 2% of its company.

The biggest layoff in terms of percent of the company was 100%. This is obvious when you realize that any company going out of business lays off 100% of its employees. The wealthiest company to go out of business was Britishvolt which had raised $2.4 billion when it laid off all 206 of its employees.

While its small companies that are more likely to go out of business, it is big companies that are responsible for the most layoffs since have more employees that can potentially be laid off.

I calculated a rolling total to track the number of employees that were laid off month to month across the world. The dataset records up until March of 2023, and the grand total of layoffs is 383,159.

Finally, I found the top 5 companies with the most layoffs for each year from 2020 to 2023. As mentioned before, it's Google that was responsible for the biggest layoff of 12,000 employees in 2023 as of March.
